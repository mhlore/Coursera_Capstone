Additionally, we will use and clean the coordinates data from another source: https://github.com/jkgiesler/parse-chicago-neighborhoods/blob/master/community_to_gps.txt. Once we have cleaned and merged this data together, we will use the Foursquare API to assess the businesses in the 77 Chicago Community Areas to identify one or more that will be suitable to open new coffee shops in.
